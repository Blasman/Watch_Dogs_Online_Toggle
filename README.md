# Watch_Dogs_Online_Toggle

An application made with AutoHotkey (v1.1) that allows you to enable and disable online services on the fly for Watch_Dogs 1 on PC.

This application was created in response to users abusing an in-game exploit commonly referred to as a "permahack." By using this application, you can now disconnect from the other player without having to exit your game.

It can also be used to safely roam around Chicago (testing out mods, whatever) without having to worry about getting invaded and without having to turn off online invasions within the game itself (and losing all online notoriety).

## Installation

**Option 1**: Download the .exe file and run it from anywhere. Select "Yes" when asked to run as administrator.

**Option 2**: Download the .ahk file and run it from anywhere. Select "Yes" when asked to run as administrator. For this method, you will need to install [AutoHotkey version 1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Usage

Click `BLOCK` to disable online services. Click `UNBLOCK` to enable online services. Click `QUICK DC` to temporarily disable online services for 6.5 seconds and automatically tab back to your game.
